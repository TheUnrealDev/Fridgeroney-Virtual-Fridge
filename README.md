# Fridgeroney

A flutter project to help users keep track of groceries by letting them manage a virtual fridge.
The application lets users scan the barcodes of groceries using their camera in order to add them to a virtual fridge. The fridge is managed through the app and is stored in a Realtime Database using Firebase.

The program was created for personal use.
